Faint hum of lab equipment powering on

Occasional tapping sounds, possibly keyboard or tools

Whispered voices, indistinct but tense, male and female tones

Muffled footsteps moving towards and away from the microphone

Sudden clatter of an object falling — metal or glass impact

Abrupt breathing, sounds of struggle with faint grunts

Whispered phrase, possibly: "You shouldn’t have come here"

Pause, then faint scratching noise, like fingernails on surface

Low rustling, maybe fabric or papers shifting rapidly

Another muffled grunt, followed by a sudden loud bang against a hard surface

Sound of footsteps retreating, pacing back and forth rapidly

Tense silence, broken by a faint electronic buzzing noise (nearby device?)

Faint repeated beeps, irregular intervals (could be a timer or alert)

Ambiguous spoken word, syllables unclear, possibly a name or code
