### **Chatlog 1: Direct Messages between Aarav Khanna and Zoya Fernandez**

**Timestamp:** 12 July 2025 (10 days before the incident)

[cite_start]**Context:** This exchange occurs after Aarav allegedly accused Zoya of using code from their old joint project for her Hackspire entry[cite: 44, 45].

**Aarav:** I saw the beta for your Hackspire project. Looks familiar.

**Zoya:** What are you talking about? It's my own work. You should be focused on getting your suspension lifted, not my code.

**Aarav:** Funny you mention that. The suspension. It’s all connected. You wouldn’t believe what I’ve found. The *real* reason Lab B was sealed.

[cite_start]**Zoya:** You sound like a lunatic[cite: 95]. You always get like this. Obsessed. Whatever you think you’ve found, leave me out of it. [cite_start]Lab B should have stayed sealed[cite: 50].

**Aarav:** I can’t. This is bigger than your stupid prize. It’s about the truth. And people are going to find out who really built what.

**Zoya:** Is that a threat? Stop talking to me. [cite_start]You’re becoming one of those psychopaths they show in documentaries[cite: 98].

### **Chatlog 2: Direct Messages between Aarav Khanna and Dr. Vishal Dey**

**Timestamp:** 15 July 2025 (7 days before the incident)

[cite_start]**Context:** This conversation takes place after Dr. Dey noticed Aarav's continued probing of the school's systems[cite: 18, 91]. [cite_start]Dr. Dey had already accessed Aarav’s student records multiple times by this point[cite: 33].

**Dr. Dey:** Aarav. I’ve noticed your activity on the network. [cite_start]I warned you to focus on your coursework[cite: 91]. Drop it.

**Aarav:** But sir, you taught me to be curious. I found something in the old server logs. Something that doesn't add up. It’s about the ’13 incident.

**Dr. Dey:** Some things are buried for a reason. [cite_start]You are a gifted student, don't waste that talent on things that don't concern you[cite: 92, 101]. This is your final warning.

**Aarav:** But it does concern me! It concerns everyone. I know what you’re trying to bury. And I can prove it.

**Dr. Dey:** You don't know what you're meddling with. Stay out of it. For your own good.

### **Chatlog 3: Encrypted Peer-to-Peer Chat between Aarav Khanna ("Cipher") and Sahil Wadhwa ("Deadpool/404")**

**Timestamp:** 18 July 2025 (4 days before the incident)

[cite_start]**Context:** This chat likely pertains to the "big" project they were working on[cite: 87]. [cite_start]The file transfer mentioned aligns with the corrupted file Aarav sent Sahil two days before his death[cite: 88].

**Cipher:** It's done. Sending you the package now. Everything is in there. [cite_start]The TRUTH[cite: 20].

**Deadpool/404:** You sure about this? Once it’s out, there’s no going back. They will come for you.

**Cipher:** I have to. They can't keep getting away with it.

**Deadpool/404:** Be careful. Remember the sim we ran? [cite_start]Sometimes, a bug has to be squashed, even if it screams[cite: 81]. Don't be that bug.

**Cipher:** It's too late for that. Just make sure the package gets out if something happens to me.

**Deadpool/404:** I will. Stay safe, man. We’re close.

### **Chatlog 4: Private Messaging App between Principal Arjun Jain and Zoya Fernandez**

**Timestamp:** 20 July 2025 (2 days before the incident)

[cite_start]**Context:** These messages were recovered from logs showing a suspicious login from the Principal's account to an app connected to Zoya's device[cite: 71, 72]. [cite_start]This conversation also hints at the financial connection between Jain and Zoya's father[cite: 64, 65].

**Arjun Jain:** Zoya, your father and I had a productive chat. Everything regarding Q-Byte Solutions is in order. You just focus on Hackspire.

**Zoya:** Thank you, Principal Jain. It's just... things have been tense. Aarav won't leave me alone. He's been making threats.

**Arjun Jain:** I am aware of Mr. Khanna's activities. [cite_start]He has a history of indulging in matters that don't belong to him[cite: 100]. I tried to help him, but some students don't want help.

**Zoya:** What if he exposes my project? Or worse?

**Arjun Jain:** Do not worry. The school knows how to protect its interests. And its most promising students. I will handle it. Just be prepared for your competition.

### **Chatlog 5: Direct Messages between Dr. Vishal Dey and Principal Arjun Jain**

**Timestamp:** 21 July 2025 (The day before the incident)

[cite_start]**Context:** This conversation directly mirrors the unsent draft email found on Dr. Dey's computer [cite: 27, 28] and reflects their shared interest in controlling the situation.

**Dr. Dey:** Arjun, the Khanna boy has become a significant liability. My previous warnings have had no effect. He accessed the archived server logs.

**Arjun Jain:** I’ve been hearing things. Zoya is worried. How much does he know?

**Dr. Dey:** He knows. Maybe not everything, but enough to cause irreparable damage. [cite_start]We either silence him or bury everything we've built[cite: 28]. The school's reputation cannot be compromised.

**Arjun Jain:** I agree. The integrity of this institution is paramount. The old lab is still sealed, correct? Access is restricted?

**Dr. Dey:** Yes. [cite_start]Only a few of us have keys[cite: 29]. [cite_start]And you have the circuit breaker override[cite: 66].

**Arjun Jain:** Good. Let's meet tomorrow morning before Hackspire. We need a permanent solution.
