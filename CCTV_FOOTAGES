#### **Footage Log 3: IT Department - Server Room Antechamber**

* **Camera ID:** IT-SRV-02
* **Timestamp:** 23:05
* **Description:** The motion-activated camera captures the door to the main server room. [cite_start]The footage is heavily corrupted and pixelated[cite: 107].
* **Analysis:** Digital forensics managed to partially restore three frames.
    * [cite_start]**Frame 1 (23:05:12):** A figure is seen standing in front of the access panel that controls the circuit breakers for the lab wing[cite: 66, 67]. The individual's build is consistent with Dr. Vishal Dey, but facial recognition is impossible.
    * **Frame 2 (23:05:18):** The figure appears to be manipulating the panel. [cite_start]A faint reflection on the glass shows what looks like a keycard with restricted access privileges[cite: 29].
    * **Frame 3 (23:05:25):** The figure is gone. A small, dark object is visible on the floor near the access panel. [cite_start]This could be the source of the forensic gel residue Dr. Dey claims was planted in his office to clone his fingerprint[cite: 35].

* **Timestamp:** 23:30 - 01:30 (Window of Murder)
* [cite_start]**Description:** Zoya Fernandez is visible with four other team members, working on their Hackspire presentation[cite: 52, 53]. The footage confirms her presence.
* **Suspicious Activity:**
    * **Timestamp: 00:15:** Zoya is seen having a heated, whispered conversation with one of her teammates. She gestures emphatically towards her laptop before abruptly walking away to a corner of the hall, out of the camera's direct line of sight.
    * **Timestamp: 00:45:** Zoya returns to the table. She appears pale and avoids interacting with the group for the next twenty minutes, focusing intently on her personal phone. [cite_start]The logs show multiple deleted messages from her private drive during this period[cite: 54].
    * [cite_start]**Note:** While her team confirms her presence, the footage shows she was emotionally distant and distracted during the key time window, which could be interpreted as guilt or trauma[cite: 56].
